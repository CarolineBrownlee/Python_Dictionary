# Dictionaries are the new Object from JavaScript.

# They are key/value pairs just like objects, but creating and accessing the key/value pairs can only be done with square-bracket notation.

# You can create dictionaries in two ways:

# 1. Create an empty dictionary
# animal = dict()

# And then add k/v pairs:
# animal["name"] = "Kevin"
# animal["breed"] = "Bulldog"
# animal["age"] = 5
# print(animal)

# 2. Create the dictionary with k/v pairs and assign to variable
# animal = {
#     "name": "Kevin",
#     "breed": "Bulldog",
#     "age": 5
# }
# print(animal)

# Dictionaries are iterable.

# for (key, value) in animal.items():
#     print(f"{key}: {value}")
